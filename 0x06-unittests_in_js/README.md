This project focuses on implementing unit and integration testing for Node.js applications using Mocha, Chai, and SinonJS. Testing ensures code reliability and validates that an application behaves as expected in different scenarios. Using Mocha, I organized test suites and leveraged hooks like before and after for setup and teardown. With Chai, I created intuitive assertions to check for expected outcomes, while SinonJS allowed me to simulate and monitor complex behaviors using spies, stubs, and mocks. I also learned to handle asynchronous functions effectively and explored integration testing by simulating API requests on a small Node.js server built with Express.

The project adheres to strict requirements, running on Ubuntu 18.04 with Node.js 12.x.x, and mandates that all tests pass without warnings or errors using npm run test *.test.js. The test coverage includes both typical and edge cases to ensure robustness. By working on this project, I developed a deeper understanding of testing tools and techniques, learned to write clean and reusable code, and gained practical experience in improving application reliability through systematic testing.

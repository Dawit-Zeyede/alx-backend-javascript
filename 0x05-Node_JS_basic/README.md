NodeBasics is a hands-on project created by ALX to help me build a solid understanding of Node.js and its practical applications. Through this project, I learned how to run JavaScript using Node.js, work with its core modules, and use specific modules like fs to read files. I also explored how to use process to access command line arguments and the environment. As part of the project, I built a small HTTP server using both Node.js and Express.js and learned how to create advanced routes with Express.js.

By the end of this project, I can confidently explain how to use ES6 with Node.js through Babel-node and speed up development with Nodemon. With these skills, I am now able to build and run dynamic, server-side JavaScript applications independently and explain these concepts to others without relying on external resources like Google.
